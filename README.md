# CogChain: Enhancing Emotional Support Conversation with Cognitive Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
We propose CogChain, a cognitive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning framework that mimics a human supporterâ€™s cognitive process for emotional support conversation. Specifically, CogChain employs a chained structure to analyze the seekerâ€™s issues, infer internal thoughts, determine behavioral intentions, and select appropriate strategies to achieve support goals.
We will release ESChain as soon as possible. ðŸ’ª
